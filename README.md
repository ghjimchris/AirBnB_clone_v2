# AirBnB Clone - The Console

The AirBnB console is a command interpreter that allows you to manage objects through interactive and non-interactive modes. This project is a basic replica of the AirBnB platform, with a focus on creating a powerful storage system that provides an abstraction between "My object" and "How they are stored and persisted." This means that you do not have to worry about how your objects are stored, whether you are using the console code, the front-end, or the RestAPI.

To start the console, use the following command: `./console.py`

You can use the console to perform the following actions:
- Manage objects (create, update, destroy, etc.)
- Store and persist objects to a JSON file
- Use the following commands: create, show, destroy, all (shows all), update, help, quit

Here's an example of how to open the console:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
